# API Weather app

When you open the live version the browser will ask if you want to allow it to get your location, if you do it will show you the current weather in your location. If you do not agree then you will get an error message.

Try to type in any other location and press enter to see the weather somewhere else in the world.

I got an API key from open https://openweathermap.org and in first function to get your current location it will get the latitude and longitude from where you are and for the function where you type in another location then the api will get it by the city or country name.
